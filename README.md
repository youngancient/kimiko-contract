# Kimiko: Onchain Medical Adherence System

## Overview

Kimiko is an on-chain medical adherence system designed to help patients manage medications. Adhering to medications, tracking doctor visits, and maintaining lifestyle changes can be overwhelming, but Kimiko aims to simplify this process by rewarding patients who stay on track with their health. Patients can also decide to share these rewards with others.

With Kimiko, patients earn **tokens** and unlock **exclusive NFTs** as they follow their prescribed treatment plans, making healthcare adherence fun and rewarding!
